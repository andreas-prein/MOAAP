# MOAAP
The Multi-Object Analysis of Atmospheric Phenomena (MOAAP) program identifies and tracks a variety of atmospheric phenomena (tropical and extratropical cyclones, mid-level cyclones, cut-off lows, anticyclones, atmospheric rivers, jet streams, fronts, mesoscale convective systems, and tropical waves) as objects in a single framework. It calculates label maps and object characteristics and can be applied to regional and global data. Please read the Wiki (https://github.com/AndreasPrein/MOAAP/wiki) for additional information.

Development of this algorithm was funded by the Research Council of Norway as part of the [FRONTIER](https://www.norceresearch.no/en/projects/the-big-data-and-climate-frontier-making-sense-of-the-explosive-increase-in-climate-data-through-smart-designs-and-big-data-methods) project (project number 301777).
