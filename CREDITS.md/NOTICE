# Credits

This repository includes substantial contributions from **Raphael Graf (ETH Zürich)**.

Raphael Graf developed a major refactoring and extension of the MOAAP code base as part of his student work at ETH Zürich. His contributions include, in particular:

- Reorganization of the code into a structured Python package (`moaap`)
- Significant extensions and improvements to the tracking and analysis functionality
- Development of comprehensive project documentation (Sphinx-based)
- Addition of example workflows and tutorial material
- Improvements to code maintainability and usability

His work was originally developed in a separate repository and has since been integrated into this repository as part of the continued development of MOAAP.

I gratefully acknowledge Raphael Graf’s contributions to the evolution of the MOAAP tracker.
