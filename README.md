# MOAAP
Method for Object-based Analysis of Atmospheric Phenomena

MOAAP is a Python package for tracking and analyzing atmospheric phenomena in 3D. Included phenomena are tropical and extratropical cyclones, mid-level cyclones, cut-off lows, anticyclones, atmospheric rivers, jet streams, fronts, mesoscale convective systems, and tropical waves. It calculates label maps and object characteristics and can be applied to regional and global data. 

## Features
